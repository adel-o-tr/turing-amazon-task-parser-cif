The Definition Applied States An Outlier X Is A Data Point Such That X Is Greater Than $1.2 \\times \\mu$ Or X Is Less Than $\\mu / 1.2$. The Mean $\\mu$ Used For This Calculation Was $15.3625$. The Upper Threshold Was $18.435$ And The Lower Threshold Was Approximately $12.8021$. A Careful And Transparent Analytical Approach Was Paramount.

E4 claimed Zone A. This means E4 is lying.\n\nSince exactly two engineers are lying we have found our liars E4 and E5.\nThis means engineers E1 E2 E3 and E6 are telling the truth.\nLet us determine their actual work **zones**:\n\n  * E1 truthfully claimed Zone A and is in Zone A.\n  * E2 truthfully claimed Zone B so E2 is in Zone B.\n  * E3 truthfully claimed Zone C so E3 is in Zone C.\n  * E4 lied about Zone A. Vicky confirmed E4 is in Zone B.\n  * E5 lied about Zone B. E5 is not in Zone B. Zone B contains {E2 E4}. Zone C contains {E3 E6}. These are full.
