        "###Outliers\n",
        "The Identified Outlier Is Month 1 With Value $12.5$. The Definition Applied States An Outlier X Is A Data Point Such That X Is Greater Than $1.2 \\times \\mu$ Or X Is Less Than $\\mu / 1.2$. The Mean $\\mu$ Used For This Calculation Was $15.3625$. The Upper Threshold Was $18.435$ And The Lower Threshold Was Approximately $12.8021$. A Careful And Transparent Analytical Approach Was Paramount. The Analytical Caveat Is That Outlier Identification Is Sensitive To The Definition Applied. Alternative Definitions Might Yield Varying Results. A Pragmatic Analysis Always Acknowledges Such Factors."
