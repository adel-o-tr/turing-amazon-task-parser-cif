        "> “During the late 19th century, European powers embarked on a frenzied period of imperial expansion, often referred to as the ‘Scramble for Africa.’ This era was marked by intense geopolitical competition, where major powers like Britain, France, Germany, and Belgium sought to claim vast swaths of African territory. Motivated by economic interests, national prestige, and a belief in their cultural superiority, these nations divided the continent with little regard for existing ethnic or political boundaries. The Berlin Conference of 1884–85 formalized this process, establishing rules for colonization that were ostensibly meant to prevent conflict between European powers but entirely excluded African voices from decision-making. The consequences of this colonial legacy continue to shape Africa’s political and social structures today, contributing to ongoing challenges related to governance, identity, and development.”\n",
